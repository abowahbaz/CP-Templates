# CP Templates :dart:

- This repository contains my implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++ through my competitive programming journey. I have tried to keep the code as clean and readable as possible.

- Every code has some TODOs for problem specific implementation (advisably use [Better Comments](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=aaron-bond.better-comments) ), make sure to read them before using the code.
- The codebase is organized into different categories for easy navigation.
- Constantly updated with new algorithms and data structures as I learn them.
