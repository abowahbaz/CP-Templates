# CP Templates :dart:

- This repository contains my implementations of various algorithms and data structures in C++ through my competitive programming journey. I have tried to keep the code as clean and readable as possible.

- Every code has some TODOs for problem specific implementation, make sure to read them before using the code.

- This repository is not meant to be a replacement for learning the concepts from scratch. It is recommended to understand the concepts first and then refer to the code for implementation.
- It's also recommended when practicing problems to implement the algorithms from scratch to get a better understanding of the concepts and to cope with the time constraints like in contests.
